# oauth2-in-action-golang

"OAuth 2 in Action" code samples re-written in golang.

I am learning [golang](https://go.dev/). As an exercise, I am re-writing the code samples from _OAuth 2 in Action_ by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso in go.

The original sources are here: https://github.com/oauthinaction/oauth-in-action-code

Being new to golang, it is not clear to me that this should be structured as a golang module. I suspect it should _not_ be structed as a golang module, though I do have a `go.mod` file in here at the moment.
